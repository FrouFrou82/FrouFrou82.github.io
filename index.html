    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Life is messy, and so are the systems we rely on. I’ve learned as much from juggling family schedules, school forms, and household workflows as I have from working across energy, government, and infrastructure.  
      I notice patterns, cut duplication, and fold insights into strategy — helping services and processes actually work for the people using them.  
      My approach blends user-centred thinking, systems thinking, agile principles and a fair splash of idisyncracy for flavour.

      By spotting patterns and cutting duplication, we can streamline processes and improve outcomes — whether at home or in digital services.</p>
